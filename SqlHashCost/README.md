Output of program:

```
Java time in ms: 1578
Db time in ms: 4033
Java time in ms: 1531
Db time in ms: 4077
Java time in ms: 1500
Db time in ms: 4096
Java time in ms: 1470
Db time in ms: 4027
Java time in ms: 1482
Db time in ms: 4156
```

Around 2.5 to 3 times more expensive to do SHA1 in database.
